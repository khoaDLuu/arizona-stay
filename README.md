## Customs/traditions/practices
* Eating out
  * In the US, it is generally expected that fast food restaurants offer free refills for soft drinks. This means that you can often refill your cup with your choice of beverage multiple times without additional charges.
  * When you enter a casual restaurant (like Applebee's, Olive Garden, or Chili's), a waiter/waitress may ask you "dine-in or takeout?" That means they are asking if you want to sit down and enjoy their meal on the premise ("dine in" or "eat in") or order their food to be packed and taken away to eat elsewhere ("takeout" or "takeaway" or "to go").
* Tipping
  * Standard (for restaurants): 15-25%
  * Counter service: 0-5%
  * Automatic gratuities: 18% to 20% of the bill
    * Often automatically added onto the bill for large parties, with more than 5 diners in the group
    * You cannot refuse to pay an automatic gratuity since the payment is a service charge
    * You can tip a few more dollars on top of that if the service is great
  * When you pay with a credit card, the process goes like this
    * You ask the server for the check (the bill in BrE) - see [Basic conversation](#basic-conversation)
    * You receive it, check the items, and put your card on it
    * The server will take your card and come back with a receipt and a pen
    * You write down the tip, do the math, and sign
    * Don't forget to take the receipt and/or a picture of it before leaving
* "Bless you"
  * After you sneeze, someone may say "Bless you"
  * The proper response is "Thank you"
* Riding shotgun
  * Riding in the front seat (when your friend is driving) is called riding shotgun
  * Claim the right to ride shotgun by being the first person to call out "shotgun" when everyone is in view of the vehicle
* Happy hour
  * "Cheers"
  * The legal drinking age is 21 (which means you cannot buy, receive, possess, or consume alcohol before 21)
  * It is likely that you will be asked to show your ID before buying beer
* Barhopping
  * Definition: the activity of visiting several bars in succession, having a drink in each
  * Fun, but not recommended ðŸ˜º
* Online shopping and delivery
  * Packages are usually dropped off at the front door and a proof-of-delivery photo may be sent to you via the app
  * Some packages may be hidden in the carport (on the left of the house, behind the trash bins)
  * Packages with high value will require identification

## Basic conversation
* Asking for checks/receipts
  * Can I have the check/bill?

## SOS
* Passport damage/loss:
  * Ask Shelby for her assistance (contact hochieu@vietnamembassy.us)
